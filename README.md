# Bayaan-Blogging-App
This a full-stack project that I did using MERN Stack. The user can login and sign up and create, read, update and delete blogs for themselves. 
## Installing Using Github
```
cd git clone https://github.com/alimustafa-poder/Bayaan-Blogging-App
```
You will need a MongoDB URI in the .env.development folder in backend.
Once your database is up and running, hit `npm run dev` in cd. Then enter `localhost:3000` in your browser.
